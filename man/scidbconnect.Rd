\description{
Connect to a SciDB database
}
\note{
The SciDB connection state is maintained internally to the \code{scidb}
package. We internalize state to facilitate operations involving \code{scidb}
objects.

Thus, only one open SciDB connection is supported at
a time.

One may connect to and use multiple SciDB databases by sequentially calling
\code{scidbconnect} between operations. Note that \code{scidb} objects are not
valid across different SciDB databases.

Use the optional \code{username} and \code{password} arguments to authenticate
the connection with the shim service. PAM-authenticated connections require
an encrypted connection with shim, available by default on port 8083.

Use the optional \code{username} and \code{password} arguments with
\code{auth_type} set to "digest" to use HTTP digest authentication (see the
shim documentation to configur this).  Digest authentication may use either
"http" or "https" transports selected by the \code{protocol} setting.

Disconnection is automatically handled by the package.

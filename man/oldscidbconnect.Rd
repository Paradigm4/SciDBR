\item{username}{optional authentication username}

\item{password}{optional authentication password}

\item{auth_type}{optional SciDB authentication type}

\item{protocol}{optional shim protocol type}

\item{init}{set to \code{TRUE} to instruct SciDB to load a lot of optional and required plug-ins once a connection is established}

\code{NULL} is returned invisibly; this function is used for its

\description{
Connect to a SciDB database
}
\note{
The SciDB connection state is maintained internally to the \code{scidb}
package. We internalize state to facilitate operations involving \code{scidb}
objects.

Thus, only one open SciDB connection is supported at
a time.

One may connect to and use multiple SciDB databases by sequentially calling
\code{scidbconnect} between operations. Note that \code{scidb} objects are not
valid across different SciDB databases.

Use the optional \code{username} and \code{password} arguments with
\code{auth_type} set to "digest" to use HTTP digest authentication (see the
shim documentation to configur this).  Digest authentication may use either
"http" or "https" transports selected by the \code{protocol} setting.

Disconnection is automatically handled by the package.

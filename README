SciDB R interface package installation notes.
---------------------------------------------


R package checks are run with (assuming package version 0.0-5):

R CMD build scidb && R CMD check scidb_0.0-5.tar.gz

or, if you don't have LaTex utilities on your system:

R CMD build scidb && R CMD check --no-manual scidb_0.0-5.tar.gz

Check output appears in the file scidb.Rcheck/00check.log.

Install the package with:

R CMD build scidb && R CMD INSTALL scidb_0.0.5-tar.gz

The package depends on the 'iterators' package, so you'll also need
to install that.

Description: A package to interact with SciDB by directly running SciDB queries using native array
    functional language (AFL) and optionally returning results as data frames. SciDB is a free 
    open-source database that organizes data in n-dimensional arrays. SciDB features include ACID
    transactions, parallel processing, distributed storage, and efficient sparse array storage. 
    SciDB arrays consist of a coordinate system whose coordinates are called dimensions, and one or
    more values at each coordinate called attributes.
